Example 
Enter number of students: 3
Enter student name: Alice
Enter Test mark: 85
Enter Assignment mark: 90
Enter Lab mark: 80
Enter student name: Bob
Enter Test mark: 78
Enter Assignment mark: 92
Enter Lab mark: 70
Enter student name: Charlie
Enter Test mark: 85
Enter Assignment mark: 85
Enter Lab mark: 85

Output-
Highest average score: ['Charlie'] with average = 85.0
Highest assignment marks: ['Bob'] with marks = 92.0
Lowest lab marks: ['Bob'] with marks = 70.0
Lowest average score: ['Bob'] with average = 80.0
